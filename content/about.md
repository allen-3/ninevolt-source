## Aspirations

This website is:

- A place for me to practice designing something and publishing it.

- A way to share a bit of what I love.

- A way to help people and help them to save time.

## Colophon

Because this website is [open source](https://github.com/allen-3/ninevolt), all assets — including fonts — are shared publically in a GitHub repository. For this reason, the fonts I use on this website are open source.

Redaction, designed by Titus Kaphar and Reginald Dwayne Betts, is used for the display type. The _ninevolt.xyz_ logo is set in Redaction 35 Italic, and titles in Redaction 20.

Body text is set in Alegreya Sans, designed by Juan Pablo del Peral at Huerta Typografica. It has a beautiful organic character that speaks of calligraphy. I think this is one of the most underappreciated free typefaces out there.

Links, for the most part, are set in Alegreya and styled in small caps. This typeface is the serif counterpart of the grotesque; together they comprise the Alegreya superfamily.
